# Briefcase
Hi there,
One day I was reminiscing about a file synchronization tool we used to have in Windows XP. After a bit of searching, I found out it was called Briefcase — a lightweight utility designed for syncing files.
Unfortunately, after Windows 10 version 21H2, it was officially discontinued and never brought back.
So I decided to build a simple and lightweight version of it myself.
Hope it comes in handy for you!
